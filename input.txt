This is a very long and detailed commit message explaining the new feature that has been added. The feature is designed to improve the user experience and provide greater functionality to the system. It involved adding new code to the backend and making changes to the front-end UI. The code has been thoroughly tested and is ready for release.

Fixed a bug that was causing the system to crash under certain circumstances. The bug was related to memory allocation and was difficult to diagnose. However, after several hours of debugging, we were able to locate and fix the issue. We have tested the fix thoroughly and are confident that it will resolve the problem.

We have updated the database schema to support new functionality, added new API endpoints, and improved the performance of several key components. This commit has undergone extensive testing and we are confident that it will not cause any issues in production.

We have tested the feature extensively and are confident that it will be well-received by our users.

Refactored the code to improve maintainability and reduce technical debt. We have updated the naming conventions to be more consistent and have removed duplicate code. These changes should make it easier for developers to work with the codebase and reduce the likelihood of bugs in the future.

This commit contains several performance optimizations. We have identified several bottlenecks in the code and have made changes to improve the speed and efficiency of the system. These changes should result in faster response times and a better user experience overall.

Updated the system to use a new version of the underlying framework. This involved updating several dependencies and making changes to the code to support the new features. We have tested the system thoroughly and are confident that it is stable and reliable.

Bug fixes and minor improvements. We have addressed several issues that were reported by our users and have made small tweaks to improve the overall experience. These changes should not have any significant impact on the system.
